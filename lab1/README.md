This folder contains all the Python / Bash / Jupyter Notebook code used to do the first assignment.

For this first assignment, what I did was to create ten Virtual Machines (VM), on
the Google Cloud Platform, each in a specific geographical position and monitor (with
the ping command) how the RTT varies based on the distance (km) from my position.

The goal is to verify that the RTT increases as the distance between the VP and the target increases.
